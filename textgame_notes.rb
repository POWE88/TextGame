Opening scene:
Its Halloween night, dark and foggy. The streets are empty and most homes around the neighborhood have turned their porch lights off to stop the door knocks and never-ending plead for candy.  With nothing to do and no adult supervision you and your friends decided to sit on the park bench and assess the loot gathered from the long night of trick or treating. After the assessment and you and your adolescent friends have already conceded to your devilish inner beings and have consumed 10lbs of candy each. Overloaded, bloated, and enthralled in your chocolate wasted state of mind you and your hooligan friends decide to play truth or dare.

Scene 2:
Decisions:
Front Door Scene:

As you and your friends approach the dark and ominous building you begin to feel apprehensive about this whole situation. Your mind spirals a bit and you think maybe this was bad idea. You think to yourself, “There’s only two options, either I get the rubies and become rich or become the laughing stock of the school. What else could possibly go wrong?” Being a small town, there isn’t another option other than home school… You approach the door. Do you knock* on the door, ring* the door bell, kick* the door open, or *runaway for your life.

Knock on door || Ring door bell || Kick the door open || Turn away running for your life.

	Knock on the door (semi friendly):

	A smiling and cheerful blonde man appears at the door in a grey goblin onesie. “Hi there! Finally, someone has visited my humble abode. I was starting to fear that I made my house a bit too scary.” You realize that the man standing before looks awfully familiar. You quickly realize that this home is the home of the new principal of your school, Mr. Damon!
	“So, *character name* what are you doing here so late at night by yourself? You should probably come in, have some hot cider, and wait here while I call your parents to come get you. Although I’m new to town I’ve got the school rolodex from the vice principal so it will only take a minute to call them.” You decide to….

        -- Take some candy and you get invited for some cider.
            Options: Go in or not
            - Go in: Hes normal guy. You have a long chat about *something*. You realize theres nothing wrong or scary about the home. Theres nothing to explore and no rubys. Urban legend.
            - Not in: B: next day at schoool....

	Ring door bell (Grabbing you in): Okay you decided to ring the doorbell just in case to see if anyone actually lives there. Last thing you want to do is get shot for B&E (breaking and entering). As your cold pale finger presses down on the doorbell, a loud Vatican like bell rings and echo’s throughout the building. The large black wood double doors open swiftly. As the doors blast open a gust of wind hits your already cold pale face. You stare into darkness for what feels like eternity. The clouds shift through the night sky and unveils the bright glowing moon. The moon’s blue ray of light helps reveal the interior of the mansion foyer. It reveals a glowing figure staring back at you. The ghost of Jez grabs your arms with brute force and you quickly lose consciousness due to the sheer fear of seeing a real-life ghost. She quickly whisks you away into a dark room where you wake up a few moments later. It’s another dark room but this room has a few lit candles, velvet red chaise, and a large five foot by five foot fireplace. The room appears to be some sort of study. In the corner of the study is an authentic Chucky doll. 
        --- Jez takes you to a  ** room ** and locks you in and gives you a riddle to solve.
            Option: Get the riddle right or wrong.
